# DeepFry
This provides deep fried nostr events for humble horse. The core problem we propose to solve is how to surface the most relevant signal in a sea of noise. 

This monorepo contains the **StrFry relay** and all associated systems that feed, enhance, and query it. 

The design uses StrFry for maximum performance and NIP compliance, while surrounding it with additional services for discovery, trust scoring, and search.

We welcome external contributors.

## Overview

- **Relay Core**: Stock [StrFry](https://github.com/hoytech/strfry) for ultra-fast event storage and delivery (LMDB backend).
- **Plugin System**: Uses StrFry’s JSON stdin/stdout plugin interface to integrate custom capabilities without forking.
- **Subsystems**: Modular services for semantic search, embeddings, trust graph building, event forwarding, profile analytics, and thread reconstruction.
- **Data Model**:
  - **Canonical events**: Stored only in StrFry LMDB.
  - **Graphs**: Stored in Dgraph as **ID-only graphs** (WoT = pubkeys, Threads = event IDs).
  - **Vectors**: Stored in pgvector (initially) for semantic search.

## Architecture Summary

- **StrFry Relay** is the single point of truth for events.
- **Event Forwarder** pulls events from upstream relays into StrFry.
- **Web of Trust Builder** in Dgraph maintains trust scores and allowlists.
- **Search Plugin** in StrFry handles NIP-50 requests and calls the **Semantic Search Service**.
- **Semantic Search** indexes events using **Embeddings Generator** and ranks them using semantic similarity, BM25, and trust scores.
- **Profile Builder** and **Thread Inference Engine** consume events from StrFry to build profiles and thread graphs.
