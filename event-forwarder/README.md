# Event Forwarder

A Nostr event forwarding service that synchronizes events between relays with real-time monitoring and resumable progress tracking.

## Overview

**Problem**: DeepFry aims to be a mega relay for Nostr. This subsystem fetches and forwards all events from a single Nostr relay for a defined sync-window, ensuring progress is stored and resumable.

**Goals**:

- Fetch all events from a Nostr relay for a sync-window
- Forward events to DeepFry relay in near real-time (<1s latency)
- Store sync progress as Nostr events on DeepFry relay (fire-and-forget)
- 100% event coverage per sync-window with resumable operation after failures

**Key Features**:

- üîÑ Real-time event synchronization between Nostr relays
- üìä Live TUI dashboard with event statistics and connection status
- üîí Cryptographic signing of sync progress events
- ‚ö° Auto-reconnection with exponential backoff and jitter
- üìà Built-in telemetry and observability

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or later
- A Nostr secret key (nsec format or 32-byte hex)
- Source relay URL (WebSocket endpoint)
- DeepFry relay URL (WebSocket endpoint)

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### TUI Stats Not Updating

If the event statistics remain at zero:

1. **Check Connection Status**: Look for red "ERROR" messages in the TUI status section
2. **Verify Relay URLs**: Ensure both source and DeepFry relay URLs are valid WebSocket endpoints
3. **Check Sync Window**: Default window is 5 seconds. If testing with inactive relays, use a longer window:

   ```bash
   ./bin/fwd --sync-window-seconds 3600  # 1 hour window
   ```

4. **Use Active Relays**: Test with public relays that have recent activity:

   ```bash
   ./bin/fwd --source wss://relay.damus.io --deepfry wss://your-relay.com --secret-key nsec1...
   ```

#### Connection Errors

- **"failed to connect to source relay"**: Source relay URL is invalid or unreachable
- **"failed to connect to deepfry relay"**: DeepFry relay URL is invalid or unreachable
- **"websocket: bad handshake"**: Relay doesn't support WebSocket connections

#### Configuration Errors

- **"flag provided but not defined"**: Using old flag names (check command line help)
- **"failed to derive keypair"**: Invalid secret key format (use nsec1... or 32-byte hex)
- **"validation error"**: Missing required configuration (source, deepfry, secret-key)

### Debug Mode

For detailed debugging, check the application's telemetry events:

```bash
# Run with verbose logging (implementation pending)
./bin/fwd --log-level debug
```

### Performance Tuning

For high-throughput scenarios:

```bash
# Increase batch size and timeouts
./bin/fwd --sync-max-batch 5000 \
          --timeout-publish-seconds 30 \
          --timeout-subscribe-seconds 30
```

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture

The application follows an event-driven architecture with the following components:

- **Forwarder**: Core sync logic that connects to relays and manages event flow
- **Telemetry**: Real-time metrics collection and aggregation
- **TUI**: Terminal user interface with live dashboard
- **Config**: Centralized configuration management with CLI/env variable support
- **Crypto**: Nostr key management and event signing

### Event Flow

```text
Source Relay ‚Üí WebSocket ‚Üí Forwarder ‚Üí Telemetry ‚Üí TUI Display
                    ‚Üì
              DeepFry Relay ‚Üê Sync Progress Event ‚Üê Event Batch
```

### Sync Progress Events

Progress is tracked using Nostr events (NIP-33, kind 30078) with tags:

- `d`: Source relay URL (identifier)
- `from`: Window start time (Unix timestamp)
- `to`: Window end time (Unix timestamp)

### Protocol Compliance

- **NIP-01**: Basic Nostr protocol for WebSocket communication
- **NIP-33**: Parameterized replaceable events for sync progress tracking
